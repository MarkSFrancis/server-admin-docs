title: Monorepo

Using a monorepo was ambitious for this project, and upon reflection, the docs and main project do not have any need to be deployed in sync.

As such, I've elected to split the `server-admin` into `server-admin-docs` and `server-admin-cli`.

Currently, only `server-admin-docs` exists. I expect to create the `-cli` part either later today, or at some point in the near future.
