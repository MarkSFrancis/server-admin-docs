# Intro

This is an attempt to organise all the things I need as a server admin, with minimal maintenance required.

The philosophy behind this site is that:

- ✅ It should accelerate my ability to manage my server(s)
- ✅ It should document any useful scripts I have for managing my data (or server(s))
- ✅ It should hold notes about the decisions or compromises I made when configuring my server(s)
- ❌ It should not duplicate existing documentation that's already maintained as OSS by someone else
- ❌ It should not hold any passwords
