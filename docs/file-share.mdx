# File share

## Linux

On Linux, I use a [CIFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block#CIFS) share to allow any Linux distro to connect.

### Install

You may need to install a few utilities, though most distros include these out-of-the-box.

:::note Installation

- This will install `cifs-utils` using `apt`
- If you're not using Debian or Ubuntu, you may need to run something different. Check your distro's package manager for details
- This command will do nothing if you already have the latest versions of the utilities installed

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cifs-utils
```

:::

### Configure

To connect to it, you'll need a couple of configuration files:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="/etc/fstab">

```bash
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Add this to the bottom of your config file, or create a new one if you don't already have one
//192.168.0.2/tank /mnt/tank cifs uid=1000,gid=0,credentials=/home/mark/tank-share-credentials,iocharset=utf8 0 0
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="/home/mark/tank-share-credentials">

```bash
username=mark
password={YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You'll also need to create the mount point:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/tank
```

To find out more about these configuration values, check out the [Ubuntu guide to mounting shares](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently)

### Run

Once you've got `cifs-utils` installed and you've configured the share, run this to reload your `fstab` config:

```
sudo mount -a
```

You should find your new share mounted in `/mnt/tank`!

## Windows

For Windows, I use a [SMB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block) share. These can be connected to via the GUI on Windows.

The server should be listed in your `Network` view (in Windows Explorer), listed as `FREENAS`. If you cannot see it, then your network may be misconfigured.

Once you've opened that, you should see a single folder called `tank`. You can open it to navigate the items in the share, or right-click, and `Map network drive..` to map it to a drive letter (such as `Z:\`)

## WSL

For WSL, I recommend that you first connect to the share on the host Windows machine. After that, we'll be using [drvfs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/file-permissions), which is a virtual file system built to connect WSL to your Windows files. You're already using it on `/mnt/c`!

### Configure

To connect to it, you'll need to configure `fstab`:

```bash title="/etc/fstab"
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Add this to the bottom of your config file, or create a new one if you don't already have one
# This example assumes your drive is mapped under `Z:`. If it's not, replace any `z` with your drive's letter
Z: /mnt/z drvfs defaults 0 0
```

You'll also need to create the mount point:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/z
```

### Run

Once you've configured the share, run this to reload your `fstab` config:

```
sudo mount -a
```

You should find your new share mounted in `/mnt/z`!

## Web

I've also added [FileBrowser](https://filebrowser.nas.place/) to exeggcute that's pointing at the share, so that you can browse the file share via your browser.

You will need a username and password to connect to it.
