# Docker

I'm using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to manage my running apps on my server. I store all my docker config on [GitHub](https://github.com/MarkSFrancis/docker-config).

That repository also includes a script to update the host's linux runtime and all containers.

<RemoteCodeBlock
  language="bash"
  title="/up.sh"

/>

:::caution
The setup I've used does not automatically install updates. This is to reduce unexpected downtime due to breaking changes in updates.

As a tradeoff, you **must** manually (and reguarly) update both the docker containers and the server itself. Failure to do so may introduce vulnerabilities.
